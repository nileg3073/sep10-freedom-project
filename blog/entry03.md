## **Content**

This week I worked on finishing all the content for **Part B** of my **Sep10Freedom project**. I organized all the tools I researched and made sure the layout is ready for the website. I split the tools into three sections: full-service design platforms, beginner-friendly templates, and vector-focused creative tools. I also wrapped up my **future innovation** idea, a design program with AI feedback, a community space, and learning resources.

It feels good to have everything in one place and ready to go.

## **Sources**

I used a bunch of official websites to make sure my info was correct. Some of the main ones were:

* Penpot’s feature list
* Akira’s documentation
* Lunacy’s overview
* RelayThat, Snappa, VistaCreate, Kittl, Vectr, and Gravit Designer websites

Checking the official pages helped me get the features and purposes right for each tool. Using multiple sources also made me feel more confident that my summaries are accurate.

## **Engineering Design Process**

Right now, I’m in the **engineering design process**, at the step **Create a Prototype**. Basically, I’ve built the full version of my website content with all the tool descriptions and my future innovation idea.

## **Skills**

Since my last blog entry, I’ve worked on a few **skills** that I can use outside of this project:

* **Research Skills:** I got better at checking multiple sources and making sure my info is correct.
* **Organization Skills:** I practiced putting a lot of info into clear sections that make sense.
* **Technical Writing Skills:** I learned how to explain tools and ideas in a way that people can understand easily.

These skills will help me with future projects and any assignments where I need to gather and explain information.

## **Professionalism**

I made sure this entry is formatted clearly with headings, paragraphs, and lists. I also checked for spelling and grammar so it’s readable and neat.

If you want, I can also **make it even shorter and more “diary-like”**, so it reads like a student’s quick reflection instead of a full formal blog. Do you want me to do that?
