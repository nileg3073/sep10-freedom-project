## Topic: Emerging Graphic Design Apps

For this stage of my Freedom Project, I focused on researching new design tools. My goal was to understand what modern apps offer, how they work, and how they change the way people design.

I looked at smaller, newer tools that compete with big software like Photoshop and Illustrator. These newer options are often free or browser-based.

## Engineering Design Process

Right now, I am in the **Research** stage of the **Engineering Design Process**. I am studying how different software works and which features are useful for my project.  
My next step will be **Brainstorming possible solutions** based on what I have learned from my research.  
This will help me plan which sources to use when I create my final product.

## Part A: Existing Technology

### Penpot
- Open-source design and prototyping tool. Designers and developers use it together in the same workspace.  
- Works in a browser and supports SVG, CSS, and HTML.  
- Good for layout design, vector art, and interactive prototypes.

### VistaCreate
- Online design platform for small businesses and non-designers.  
- Offers templates, stock assets, drag-and-drop editing, and AI object remover.  
- Best for social media graphics and quick brand visuals.

## Part B: Possible Future Technology

- **AI layout generation**  
  AI tools are starting to generate full design layouts from text prompts.  
  For example, Kittl Flows makes instant variations of a poster design.

- **Code-based design tools**  
  Penpot uses real code in its designs. Future design tools might export ready-to-use HTML and CSS.

- **Customizable asset libraries**  
  VistaCreate shows how design tools use large asset libraries and custom brand kits.  
  Future apps will likely include more templates and reusable design systems.

## Why These Matter

- A color-accurate monitor ensures your final design matches your vision.  
- External drives keep files safe and give extra space for large projects.  
- Docks and adapters make multitasking easier when working with multiple screens.  
- Portable drives let you stay productive anywhere.

## Skills

Since the first entry, I have developed two main skills.

**More Research skills:**  
I learned how to compare multiple sources and evaluate which tools are worth using. This helps me make better design choices.

**Technical skills:**  
I improved my ability to understand how different software and hardware connect in a professional workflow.

## Next Steps

My next goal is to move into the **Brainstorming** phase of the **Engineering Design Process**.
