# Entry 1: Finalization of topic choice (Graphic Design)
## Date: 10/06/2025
## Picking of a topic:
The topic that I have chosen for my _**sep10-freedom-project**_ is [**Graphic Design**](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/graphic-design?srsltid=AfmBOoqoneXcNJGefdlFL5rN2dL5cNOLzc3kREthgDztm7hv99b0sULp), as this is a pretty interesting field of work, as I work at [_**NYU Langone - Project Reach Youth SAFE**_](https://www.prysafe.com/) in the **Media, Outreach & Branding (MOB)** section of the place. Working there and getting started on [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) was very beneifical to me as I ended up discovering a new interest besides Software Engineering/Computer Science as my main interest, meeting new people and friends & finding a new community. Since, **Computer Science/Software Engineering** is already a figment of technology, with my job being in the question I decided to choose that as my topic. There are some articles that I find pretty interesting, [5 programs that graphic designers use](https://www.coursera.org/articles/graphic-design-software), Which gives some information about the specific programs that are being used to design. [What does a Graphic Designer Do?](https://www.coursera.org/articles/what-does-a-graphic-designer-do), Basically just gives a rundown of what they do, the takeways from that work field & the salary/payments you get. [What is Graphic Design?](https://www.figma.com/resource-library/what-is-graphic-design/) This gives the basic definition of graphic designing, with explaining specific elements and particular skills you get from graphic designing. With all of these articles, It further expanded my interest towards Graphic Design, as it gave thorough and meaningful information on my topic.

## Engineering & Design Process
Currently, I am on _(Step 1)_ where I am defining, and _(Step 2)_ which is the researching aspect of **EDP (engineering design process)**. But before that, we are trying to identify what we are mostly passionate about, then comes the thorough research about technology that is utilized in the career chosen. For example, Graphic designers often use specialized software, primarily vector editors **(like Adobe Illustrator and Affinity Designer)**, raster editors **(like Adobe Photoshop and GIMP)**, and layout software **(like Adobe InDesign and Figma)**, to create and edit visual content. With all of that in mind, _(Step 2)_ will be little process for me before I'm ready to go on with brainstorming possible solutions.

## Skills
There are plenty of valuable skills that I have picked up from typing and working on this blog.

### Research
Doing some research about Graphic Design before hand was pretty helpful as without sufficient research, I would be completely clueless on what to write about for this blog.

### Time Management
Pretty crucial to school work, as you need to be able to manage your time effectively and consistently, to stay on top of your school work and grades. I made sure to complete this blog whenever I had free time, instead of procasinating it an d holding it off towards the last minute.

### Outgoing 
Usually, I am very weary about sharing things like this to people where they can see, but this project puts me out of my comfort zone and enables me to be comfortable with my work being public and what I say to be on blast.

## Next Steps:
Other than that, I am very excited to go forward with the next steps of this amazing project, thank you for reading my first ever blog of this project! speak to you soon in the next one.
