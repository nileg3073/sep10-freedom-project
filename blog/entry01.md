# Entry 1: Finalization of topic choice (Graphic Design)
## Date: 10/06/2025
## Picking of a topic:
The topic I have chosen for my _SEP10 Freedom Project_ is **[Graphic Design](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/graphic-design?srsltid=AfmBOoqoneXcNJGefdlFL5rN2dL5cNOLzc3kREthgDztm7hv99b0sULp)**. This is a pretty interesting field of work, especially since I work at *[NYU Langone - Project Reach Youth SAFE](https://www.prysafe.com/)* in the _**Media, Outreach & Branding (MOB)**_ section. Working there and getting started on *[Canva](canva.com)* has been very beneficial to me. I ended up discovering a new interest outside of my main focus, which is **Software Engineering/Computer Science.** Through this experience, I’ve also met new people, made friends, and found a new community.

Since Computer Science/Software Engineering is already a part of the tech world, and my job touches on design through technology, I decided to focus on Graphic Design for this project.

I’ve come across some articles that I found really helpful:

["5 Programs That Graphic Designers Use"](https://www.coursera.org/articles/graphic-design-software) – This gives information about popular software tools used in the field.

["What Does a Graphic Designer Do?"](https://www.coursera.org/articles/what-does-a-graphic-designer-do) – A breakdown of their day-to-day work, career takeaways, and salary info.

["What is Graphic Design?"]((https://www.figma.com/resource-library/what-is-graphic-design/)) – Offers a clear definition along with key elements and the essential skills involved in the field.

With all of these articles in mind, my knowledge and interest in graphic design have grown exponentially.

## Engineering & Design Process
Currently, I’m working through:

Step 1: Define

Step 2: Research

Before diving into solutions, we’re focusing on identifying what we’re most passionate about. Then, we begin researching the technology used in the career we chose.

For example, **graphic designers often use specialized software like:**

- **Vector editors** (Adobe Illustrator, Affinity Designer)

- **Raster editors** (Adobe Photoshop, GIMP)

- **Layout software** (Adobe InDesign, Figma)

With this knowledge, I feel confident that Step 2 will be smooth, and I’ll soon be ready to move on to brainstorming possible solutions.

Skills I’ve Gained

There are several valuable skills I’ve picked up from working on this blog:

Research:
Doing research beforehand was extremely helpful. Without it, I would’ve had no idea what to write.

Time Management:
Time management is key in school and life. I made sure to work on this blog during my free time instead of procrastinating until the last minute.

Being Outgoing:
Usually, I’m very cautious about sharing personal work where others can see it. But this project pushed me out of my comfort zone and helped me feel more confident in sharing my thoughts publicly.

Next Steps

I’m very excited to move forward with the next steps of this amazing project. Thank you for reading my first-ever blog post for the Freedom Project. Speak to you again in the next one!
