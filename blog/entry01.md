# Entry 1: Finalization of topc choice (Graphic Design)
## Date: 10/06/2025
## Picking of a topic:
The topic that I have chosen for my _**sep10-freedom-project**_ is [**Graphic Design**](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/graphic-design?srsltid=AfmBOoqoneXcNJGefdlFL5rN2dL5cNOLzc3kREthgDztm7hv99b0sULp), as this is a pretty interesting field of work, as I work at [_**NYU Langone - Project Reach Youth SAFE**_](https://www.prysafe.com/) in the **Media, Outreach & Branding (MOB)** section of the place. Working there and getting started on [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) was very beneifical to me as I ended up discovering a new interest besides Software Engineering/Computer Science as my main interest, meeting new people and friends & finding a new community. Since, **Computer Science/Software Engineering** is already a figment of technology, with my job being in the question I decided to choose that as my topic.

## Engineering & Design Process
Currently, I am on _(Step 1)_ where I am defining, and _(Step 2)_ which is the researching aspect of **EDP (engineering design process)**. But before that, we are trying to identify what we are mostly passionate about, then comes the thorough research about technology that is utilized in the career chosen. For example, Graphic designers often use specialized software, primarily vector editors **(like Adobe Illustrator and Affinity Designer)**, raster editors **(like Adobe Photoshop and GIMP)**, and layout software **(like Adobe InDesign and Figma)**, to create and edit visual content. With all of that in mind, _(Step 2)_ will be little process for me before I'm ready to go on with brainstorming possible solutions.
