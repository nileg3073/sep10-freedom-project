        <h1> Contextual Information</h1>
        <p>Graphic design is something I’ve always been interested in. It’s everywhere: logos, posters, apps, packaging. For this project, I wanted to go beyond the big names like Photoshop and Illustrator. I started looking into lesser-known tools that offer different features or are easier to use. These smaller apps are often free, open-source, or browser-based. Some are built for beginners and  others use AI to speed things up. I’m using this project to explore what’s out there and see how these tools work in real design tasks. This helps me figure out what kind of tools work best for me and where graphic design might be going in the future!</p>
