# Context:
- Graphic design shows up in logos, posters, apps, and packaging. I want to understand how newer tools support this work. I chose to focus on emerging apps that offer simple workflows, clear interfaces, or AI support. These tools often run in the browser, support fast edits, and help beginners and advanced users. I researched about them to see how they handle real tasks.
