Topic: **Emerging Graphic Design Apps**

## Overview / Introduction / Context
Graphic design is something I’ve always been interested in. It’s everywhere: logos, posters, apps, packaging. For this project, I wanted to go beyond the big names like Photoshop and Illustrator. I started looking into lesser-known tools that offer different features or are easier to use.

These smaller apps are often free, open-source, or browser-based. Some are built for beginners and  others use AI to speed things up. I’m using this project to explore what’s out there and see how these tools work in real design tasks.

This helps me figure out what kind of tools work best for me and where graphic design might be going in the future!

## Part A: Existing Technology

* Penpot

  * Open‑source design and prototyping tool. Designers and developers collaborate in the same workspace. ([Penpot][1])
  * Works in browser or self‑hosted, supports SVG, CSS, HTML. ([GitHub][2])
  * Ideal for layout design, vector art, interactive prototypes.
  * Link: [https://penpot.app/](https://penpot.app/)

* VistaCreate (formerly Crello)

  * Online graphic design platform aimed at small businesses and non‑designers. ([VistaCreate Help Center][3])
  * Offers templates, stock assets, drag‑and‑drop editing, AI object remover. ([Daidu.ai][4])
  * Useful for social media graphics, brand visuals, quick marketing design.
  * Link: [https://create.vista.com/](https://create.vista.com/)

* Kittl

  * Browser‑based design platform with vector editing, typography focus, AI features. ([AiToolBrowser][5])
  * Offers templates, assets, text effects, free plan. ([Kittl][6])
  * Link: [https://www.kittl.com/](https://www.kittl.com/)

## Part B: Possible Future Technology

* AI‑powered automatic design generation

  * Some platforms like Kittl integrate features to generate entire layouts from prompts. Example: Kittl Flows generates stylistic variations automatically. ([Reddit][7])
  * Future tools may let you specify “make a poster for a skateboarding brand” and receive a full editable layout.

* Code‑centric design tools bridging designers and developers

  * Tools like Penpot emphasize design expressed as code (CSS, HTML, SVG). ([Penpot][1])
  * Future: design tools generate clean code ready to implement or export across platforms.

* More asset libraries + customizability for niche workflows

  * VistaCreate offers huge library of assets, custom brand kits, and resizing for different channels. ([cultofmac.com][8])
  * Suggests future tools will integrate cross‑platform formats, asset reuse, team workflows.

## Part C: Hardware Gadgets/Items:

• [ASUS ProArt PA279CV 27″ 4K Monitor](https://www.microcenter.com/product/634870/PA279CV_27%22_4K_UHD_%283840_x_2160%29_60Hz_LED_Monitor;_HDR;_HDMI_DisplayPort;_3-Sided_Frameless;_Flicker-Free?storeID=115&utm_source=chatgpt.com): A monitor with full-HD or better resolution, wide color gamut and accurate color matching helps you see your design the way it will print or display. Experts list monitors as essential hardware for designers. ([Creative Bloq][9])
• [LaCie/Rugged SSD4 2‑TB External SSD](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1919519-REG/lacie_stnd2000400_2tb_rugged_ssd4_usb4.html?kw=LA2TBRSSD4&ap=y&smp=Y&BI=E7249&utm_source=chatgpt.com): Large external storage gives you space for big files and backups. One design school recommends 1-2 TB USB 3.0 external drives as a minimum. ([Huntington University][10])
• [Insignia 2.5″ SATA→USB‑C HDD Enclosure](https://www.bestbuy.com/product/insignia-2-5-sata-to-usb-c-hdd-enclosure-black/J2FPJKSY68/sku/6500319?utm_source=chatgpt.com): An accessory that lets you turn existing drives into portable storage. Useful when you want flexible, affordable expansion.
• [j5create 4K60 Elite USB‑C Triple‑Monitor Dock](https://en.j5create.com/products/jcd397?variant=42260222574841&country=US&currency=USD&utm_source=chatgpt.com): A docking station gives you the flexibility to hook up multiple monitors, external drives and other gear easily.
• [BenQ DesignVue PD2705U 27″ 4K Monitor](https://www.adorama.com/bqpd2705u.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com): A second monitor option that emphasizes accuracy (99% sRGB / Rec.709) and connectivity for professional work.
• [WD G‑DRIVE 6‑TB Desktop Hard Drive](https://www.adorama.com/sdphf1a006t.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com): High‐capacity internal/external drives let you store massive projects locally.
• [Dell 27‑Plus 4K Monitor](https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-27-plus-4k-monitor-s2725qs/apd/210-brnd/monitors-monitor-accessories?tfcid=91049735&dgc=opl&utm_source=chatgpt.com): Another monitor choice with 99% sRGB coverage, showing how monitors are a recurring critical piece of gear.
• [Samsung T7 1‑TB Portable SSD](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1726783796/custom-engraved-t7-1tb-ssd-personalized?gao=1&gpla=1&utm_source=chatgpt.com): A compact portable SSD for projects on the go or transferring files between machines.

**Why each matters:**

* A good monitor ensures what you design is what others see. For example, accuracy in color and resolution matters whether you design for print or web. ([Creative Bloq][11])
* External storage prevents you from losing work, and gives you room for large files like high-res images, videos or multiple versions. ([Shillington Education][3])
* Docking stations and enclosures improve your workflow by making it easy to connect multiple devices or repurpose drives.
* Having more than one monitor or large screen workspace helps when you multitask—editing one part of a design while referencing another.
* Portable drives matter if you want to move between home, school, studio or laptop setups.
